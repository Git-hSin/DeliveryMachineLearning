# DeliveryMachineLearning
Machine learning application based on delivery data for predictive analysis.

## Introduction
E-commerce has seen tremendous growth this century. Companies like Amazon and Ebay have reaped the rewards of a market
that seeks to connect products to consumers, translating digital interactions to purchases of physical products. As the industry grows,
complementary industries are poised to benefit alongside it. The delivery industry, in particular, is an essential piece in connecting
consumers and businesses. As consumers increasedly make purchasing decisions based on time to deliver, competitors in the delivery industry
must fight for advantages in reducing that measurement. Knowing the variables that contribute to a delivery can help determine a model that
aims to improve on the time to deliver measurement for a delivery company. Using `package` and `Python 3.7` a machine learning model is developed
to provide insight via a front end application for business intelligence users of the delivery company.
